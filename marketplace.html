                        Real estate is one of the few industries that has failed to adapt to technological changes in the last many years, both in terms of cost-value and customer experience. Time-consuming and complicated procedures, as well as a lack of data and transparency, make any transaction displeasing for every party involved.

                <div class="project_desc_text">
                    User and competitor research played a huge role in creating the main product of Prosperty. My team and I conducted research before, during, and after the design phase. More precisely, we did the following: 
                    <ul class="list">
                            <li> Competitors analysis</li>
                            <li>Google analytics (Old product)</li>
                            <li>Session recording analysis through Hotjar (Old product)</li>
                            <li> Heatmap analysis through Hotjar (Old product)</li>
                            <li>Online feedback gathering though Hotjar (Old product)</li>
                            <li>Workshops to create user personas</li>
                            <li>Modarated remote usability Testing</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="project_desc_text">
                    We separated the product into two parts: static pages and functional product. The first part is more about raising awareness of what Prosperty does. We collaborated with the head of Marketing and the copywriter to create pages that speak directly to our users needs and concerns. The second part is about the interactivity and experience users have with the product.

                <h3 class="sub_title">STATIC PAGES</h3>
                <div class="project_desc_text">
                    As Prosperty is a newly built company aiming to disrupt the real estate sector, it needs to communicate a lot of information to the end customer. Understanding the best practices of landing pages and how users scan them, we managed to balance the amount of information, the visual components, and the length of the page. The challenging part was creating 19 different static pages under the same branding guidelines and with different characteristics to avoid repetition.

                 <h3 class="sub_title">SEARCH</h3>
                <div class="project_desc_text">
                    Searching for a property can be frustrating. We wanted to design an effortless and minimal search functionality that can assist all different buying and renting needs. Our personas can search for properties to buy, rent, and auction. Also, they may choose multiple property categories such as residential, commercial, plot, block of flats, and hotels. The challenge here was to help every user, with their own needs, find the ideal property quickly. After numerous user interviews and research, we decided to design two alternatives for how a user can view all the available properties. The first is a list view combined with a map, and the second is a map view.

                <div class="project_desc_text"> 
                    The presentation of each property is essential for the buyer and the property owner. Also, the property page is the final step that determines the most valuable conversion metrics. The challenge of this page was the multiple inner flows that it contains. More precisely, a user can:
                      

                       <ul class="list">
                           <li>Submit an interest form to an agent</li>
                           <li>Schedule a property tour</li>
                           <li>Ask for a morgage</li>
                           <li>Request a marketability report with  area data</li>

                           <li>Attend an auction (If the property is at auction)</li>
                           <li>Calculate commute from the property</li>

                    Anyone who wishes to publish a property in Prosperty can do so online! The process had to be quick and easy to serve our owner persona. After conducting workshops with our agents and property managers, we collected the required fields an owner has to fill including some that are optional but help our agents.

So building a  scalable design system that will support the creation of different products was an important parameter. We formed our design principles, created our foundation with basic design rules and standards referring to our color palette, typography, spacing, imagery and built a component library.
