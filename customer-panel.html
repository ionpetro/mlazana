                    User and competitor research played a huge role in creating the main product of Prosperty. My team and I have conducted research before, during, and after the design phase. More precisely, we did the following: 
                    <ul class="list">
                            <li> Competitors analysis</li>

                <h3 class="sub_title">THE CHALLENGE</h3>
                <div class="project_desc_text">
                    The biggest challenge was to make a scalable product for entirely different personas that could be separated or combined. We have a buyer (one persona with many profiles and intentions) and a property owner, which sometimes can be the same person. We managed to create a general panel for every persona but, simultaneously, smart and personalized. We applied the pages needed in a sidebar, and we kept one important rule:                  
                </div>
                <div class="project_desc_text">
                    - If a user has a listed property, then he/she is definitely an owner (and a potential buyer); otherwise, the user is, at the moment, a buyer.                  
                </div>
                <div class="project_desc_text">
                    With that rule, we succeeded in having a panel that shows and hides components based on the persona. For example, inside the ‚ÄúMy offers‚Äù page, the user can see the components that match their intentions.
